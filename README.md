# AgenticAI

AgenticAI is a modular framework for building agentic and LLM-powered applications in Python. It provides tools, workflows, and examples for working with language models, vector databases, document loaders, and custom AI agents.

## Features
- Modular agent and workflow design
- Integration with LangChain, LangGraph, HuggingFace, Google Gemini, and more
- Vector database support (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
- Document loading and text splitting utilities
- Built-in and custom tools for Wikipedia, YouTube, and web search
- Example notebooks for agentic workflows and LLM applications

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prayag001/AgenticAI.git
   cd AgenticAI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables (e.g., API keys) in a `.env` file.

## Usage
- Explore the example notebooks in the `4-LangGraph/` and `2-Langchain_Basics/` folders
- Run Jupyter notebooks for hands-on demos
- Customize agent workflows and tools for your own use cases
